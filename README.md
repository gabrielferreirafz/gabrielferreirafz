# Gabriel Ferreira
My name is Gabriel Ferreira, 20 years old, and currently studying Software Engineering at UNDB. I’m committed to continuous self-development, always aiming to improve physically, mentally, and professionally. At the moment, I’m focused on back-end development with Python through Alura, and I plan to work with Java as well in the back-end field in the future.
